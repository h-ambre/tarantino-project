"Tarantino's Movies" is a personal project developed as the final checkpoint during my web developer training at Wild Code School. The project was completed as the fourth checkpoint and had a duration of two days for individual work.</p>

Additionally, users have the ability to contribute by adding information about upcoming movies or any missing ones. The site also offers the functionality to view the movies on streaming platforms where they are available.</p>
